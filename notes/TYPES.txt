- PropertyPath:
    - Sequence representing the path to a property in the object hierarchy.

- CloneCountPropertyPath:
    - Property path that includes clone count properties.

- NonCloneCountPropertyPath:
    - Property path that excludes clone count properties.

- CloneCountResult:
    - Clone count evaluated for a property path.

- AnnotatedSegment:
    - Segment of a property path annotated with clone count information.

- AnnotatedPropertyPath:
    - Property path where each segment is annotated with clone counts.

- PropertyInstancePathSegment:
    - Segment of a property instance path, possibly including clone indices.

- PropertyInstancePath:
    - Expanded property path representing a specific instance with clone indices.

- PropertyInstanceResult:
    - Property: The property being evaluated.
    - Value: The computed value for the property instance.

- ObjectInstanceResult:
    - PropertyInstanceResults: A collection of evaluated property instances for an object.
        - Property: The evaluated property.
        - Value: The computed value for the property.

- CanvasObjectResult:
    - CanvasObject: The canvas object being processed.
    - ObjectInstanceResult: Contains the property results for the canvas object.
        - Property: The evaluated property on the object.
        - Value: The computed value for the property.

- CanvasPropertyResult:
    - CanvasObject: The canvas object from which the property is extracted.
    - PropertyInstanceResult: The evaluated property instance on the canvas object.
        - Property: The evaluated property.
        - Value: The computed value.

- PropertySetterInstance:
    - PropertySetter: The function to set the property.
    - CanvasObject: The canvas object on which the property is set.
    - Value: The value to apply via the setter.

- PathSegments:
    - The individual segments that make up a property path.

- FullyExpandedPath:
    - A property path where all clone counts have been expanded into specific instances.

- PartiallyExpandedPath:
    - A property path that has been partially expanded and may require further expansion.

- InstanceSegment:
    - Segment representing a specific instance of an object after clone expansion.
