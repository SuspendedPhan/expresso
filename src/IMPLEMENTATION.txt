ExpandInstancePaths - Converts PropertyPaths to PropertyInstancePaths by expanding clone counts.

---
AcquireCanvasObjects - Acquires CanvasObjects for each object instance.

---
ExtractCanvasProperties - Extracts individual properties from library canvas objects for further processing.
--->



---
MapPropertySetters - Maps extracted properties to their corresponding setter functions.
    - needs GetPropertySetter(property)

---
ExecutePropertySetters - Applies the setter functions to update the properties on library canvas objects.
