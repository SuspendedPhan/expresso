I will construct a project at runtime. The project's root objects will be evaluated on each frame.
Write a concise spec of how it should be evaluated. Don't need to use full sentences, and you can use symbols where appropriate.
The spec should be easily grokkable at a glance.

[Project]
  ├─ has → [ExObject] (root objects) *
  ├─ has → [Component] *
  └─ has → [ExFunc] *

[ExObject]
  ├─ has → [Component]
  ├─ has → [BasicProperty] *
  ├─ has → [ComponentParameterProperty] *
  ├─ has → [CloneCountProperty]
  ├─ has → [CloneNumberTarget]
  └─ has → [ExObject] * (children)

[Component]
  └─ has → [ComponentParameter] *

[Property]
  ├─ types:
  │    ├─ [BasicProperty]
  │    ├─ [ComponentParameterProperty]
  │    └─ [CloneCountProperty]
  └─ has → [Expr]

[ExFunc]
  ├─ has → [ExFuncParameter] *
  └─ has → [Expr]

[Expr]
  ├─ types:
  │    ├─ [NumberExpr]
  │    ├─ [ReferenceExpr]
  │    └─ [CallExpr]
  ├─ may have → [Expr] * (if CallExpr has arguments)
  └─ may have → [ReferenceTarget] (if ReferenceExpr has a target)

[NumberExpr]
  └─ has → value: number

[ReferenceExpr]
  └─ has → target: [ReferenceTarget]

[CallExpr]
  ├─ has → exFunc: [ExFunc]
  └─ has → args: [Expr] *

[ReferenceTarget]
  ├─ types:
  │    ├─ [Property]
  │    ├─ [ComponentParameter] (kind: "Custom")
  │    ├─ [ExFuncParameter]
  │    └─ [CloneNumberTarget]
